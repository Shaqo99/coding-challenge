# 9Spokes Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I decided to use React and ES6 for this challenge as the language is part of 9Spokes tech stack.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests were run on the equations for calculating revenue, expense, gross profit margin, net profit margin,
and working capital ratio. Unit tests were run using the [https://jestjs.io/](Jest) framework.

### Output of Unit Tests

*Gross profit margin is $0 as there were no entries that matched the conditions for it.
